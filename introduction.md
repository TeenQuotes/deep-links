# What are deep links?
For mobile apps, deep linking consists of using a URI that links to a specific location within a mobile app rather than simply launching the app. In short, you can get directly to the right view of the app. Here are listed paths used for [mobile deep links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_deep_linking) in the Teen Quotes website.

# Standards
Teen Quotes uses [AppLinks](http://applinks.org/documentation/) for metadata. Take a look at the documentation.

iOS and Android packages are available in order to implement deep linking.
